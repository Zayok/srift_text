            <p>T his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of
                ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried
                to clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched
                along
                with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
                bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can
                moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.</p>

                The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the
                most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should
                please
                the buffaloes to get out of the way.
                Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of
                revolvers upon them.

                "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if
                they were
                not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his
                programme! And
                here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"
